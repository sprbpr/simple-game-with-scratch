# Simple Game with Scratch

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a free programming language and online community. With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share your creations with others in the online community. Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively — essential skills for life in the 21st century. Scratch is designed, developed, and moderated by the Scratch Foundation, a nonprofit organization. It is provided free of charge.

In this project, we implement a simple game called **Snowman**. The purpose of the game is to prevent the snowman from hitting the sun and collecting as many snowflakes as possible. The more snowflakes you get, the harder the gameplay becomes.

## Installation

There are two ways to run this project:

- Use the online simulator.
- Download and install the offline application

In both cases, the game runs well. If you're just interested in trying the game, I recommend you to use the online version. It's really simple, and you don't need to install anything. But if you are curious enough to make your own game, I suggest you install the offline version so that you can write your game anytime without access to the internet.

In order to get the latest version of the Scratch application, you can follow the instruction provided in the [download page](https://scratch.mit.edu/download) of their website. On this page, they explain how to install the application for a variety of operating systems in addition to what are the requirements. Also, they provide previous versions of their application, in the case of you found a similar project but in the older version.

## Getting Started

First of all, you need to clone the project by following command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sprbpr/simple-game-with-scratch.git
```

Then, if you want to use the online version of Scratch, visit their [website](https://scratch.mit.edu/). From the navigation bar, click on `create`. On this page, you can write your own game or you can load the `snowman.sb3` file from the project, by clicking on the `file` option in the navigation bar and then choosing the `Load from your computer` option.

When the game is loaded, you have this option to modify the game or fullscreen the game screen by clicking on the full-screen option on the top-right corner of the page. Now, you're ready to play, enjoy!
