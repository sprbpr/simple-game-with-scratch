# Simple Game with Scratch

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a free programming language and online community. With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share your creations with others in the online community. Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively — essential skills for life in the 21st century. Scratch is designed, developed, and moderated by the Scratch Foundation, a nonprofit organization. It is provided free of charge.

In this project, we implement a simple game called **Snowman**. The purpose of the game is to prevent the snowman from hitting the sun and collecting as many snowflakes as possible. The more snowflakes you get, the harder the gameplay becomes.
